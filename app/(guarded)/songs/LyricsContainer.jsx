          I was so tender

          I was so tender
          <br />
          Now born the same
          <br />
          And born lost forever
          <br />
          I said; Born forever
          <br />
          I said; Born together again
          <br />
          I said
          <br />
          So sensitive
          <br />
          So tender
          <br />
          I’ll say
          <br />
          <br />
          She tranquilizes with tranquil eyes
          <br />
          <br />
          I’ll try not to lose you
          <br />
          Ill never lose heart again
          <br />
          (When can I go back)
          <br />
          <br />
          Where have you all gone anyway?
          <br />
          It’s not the scene without you
          <br />
          I’ll say
          <br />
          <br />
          God, what is this new place where my impulse can be found
          <br />
          Fall down the spiral staircase where my friends can be found
          <br />
          <br />
          How can I just stay home?
          <br />
          When can I go back to the broken city?
          <br />
          (When can I go back)
        </p>
